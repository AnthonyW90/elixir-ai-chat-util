      "content": "The phrase \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\" is a tongue twister and a classic example of playful language rather than a question meant to be answered literally. However, a humorous answer often cited is that a woodchuck would chuck about 700 pounds of wood if it could chuck wood, according to a study done by a fish and wildlife technician named Richard Thomas in 1988. Ultimately, it's all in good fun!",
